## Introduction

As a data scientist or machine learning practitioner, having a robust development environment is crucial. This guide will walk you through setting up VSCode, which is a lightweight, powerful source code editor that runs on your desktop.

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code over time. GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. Together, they form a critical part of modern software development workflows.

## Visual Studio Code Setup

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a free, open-source editor that supports a range of programming languages with powerful features like debugging, task running, and version control.
