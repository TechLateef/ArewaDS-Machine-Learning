# Set-up instructions for MacOS

# Objective

Welcome to the MacOS setup guide for the Arewa Data Science Fellowship. The objective of this tutorial is to guide you through the essential steps to configure your MacOS environment for data science work. By the end of this tutorial, you will have successfully installed and set up key tools including [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/). These tools are fundamental for your journey in data science and will be used extensively throughout the fellowship. You'll learn how to set up your computer - follow the link to your MacOS type ➡️

### MacOS Intel Setup

Some of the steps in the following sections will require `Homebrew` for MacOS. `Homebrew` is a package manager - it helps you installing software. Installing `Homebrew` will make it easier to install software that we will use later on.

**Step 1:** Open a terminal in one of the following ways:
* In Finder <img src='media/finder.png' alt='Finder' width="4%" />, open the `/Applications/Utilities` folder, then double-click `Terminal`.
* Press <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> then type `terminal` and press <kbd>enter</kbd>.

    The terminal should now be open:

    <img src='media/mac_terminal.png' width="50%" />

**Step 2:** To install `Homebrew` for MacOS, copy and paste the following line in the terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

**Step 2.1:** Sometimes it's necessary to install `xcode command line utils`. To do so, execute the following command before installing `Homebrew`:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

You may be prompted to install the `Command Line Developers Tools`. Confirm and once it finishes, continue installing `Homebrew` by pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> again.

**Step 3:** Open a terminal and run the following command to update `Homebrew`. The verbose option means that `Homebrew` will tell you what it's doing - you will see a lot of text output in your terminal:

```bash
brew update --verbose
```

**Step 4:** Now run the following command to install `git`. `Git` is a version control software that facilitates collaboration of people working together on the same code and keeps track of the versions as the code changes. You will learn more about `git` in this course.

```bash
brew install git
```

**Step 5:** Now run the following command to install `Python 3.9`:

```bash
brew install python@3.9
```

**Step 6:** then run the following command to set the default `python3` version to 3.9:

```bash
brew link python@3.9
```

And you're done! Go back continue with setting up Git and GitHub in step 3.

### MacOS M1 Setup

So you've got the new M1 and you're super happy with how fast it is. Unfortunately dealing with Apple silicon requires a little detour. But don't worry, we'll be able to get there in the end.

**Step 1:** Open a terminal in one of the following ways:
* In Finder <img src='media/finder.png' alt='Finder' width="4%" />, open the `/Applications/Utilities` folder, then double-click `Terminal`.
* Press <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> then type `terminal` and press <kbd>enter</kbd>.

    The terminal should now be open:

    <img src='media/mac_terminal.png' width="50%" />

**Step 1.1:** To use Intel-based software, you'll need `Rosetta2`. Most of you should already have it installed. If you don't have it yet, simply run the following line in the terminal:

```bash
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

This will launch the rosetta installer and you’ll have to agree to a license agreement.

**Step 2:** To install `Homebrew x86` version, aka `ibrew` for MacOS, copy and paste the following line in the terminal. `Homebrew` is a package manager - it helps you installing software. Installing `Homebrew` will make it easier to install software that we will use later on.

```bash
arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

**Step 2.1:** Sometimes it's necessary to install `xcode command line utils`. To do so, execute the following command before installing `Homebrew`:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Step 3:** Add an alias with `ibrew` to your `$PATH` (so that you computer can find `ibrew` when you call it from the terminal):

```bash
echo 'alias ibrew="arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

**Step 4:** Activate the alterations done to the `.zshrc` file:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Step 5:** Install `Python 3.9` with `ibrew`:

```bash
ibrew install python@3.9
```

**Step 6:** Add `Python 3.9` to `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.9/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
```

**Step 7** Re-activate the alterations done to the `.zshrc` file:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

And you're done! Go back to the main menu and continue with setting up Git and GitHub in step 3.
