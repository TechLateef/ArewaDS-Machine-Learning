### 1. When I open Windows Explorer through Ubuntu, it goes to a different folder than in the guide

Please make sure:

- you are running the command `explorer.exe .` including the dot at the end.
- you are running Windows 10 version `1909` or newer.

### 2. Ubuntu on Windows 10 high CPU usage, crashes

- Make sure you are running Windows 10 version `1909` or newer.
- Then, try following [these steps](https://teckangaroo.com/enable-windows-10-virtual-machine-platform/)


### 5. When I use the `cp` command the `>` sign appears and the command does not execute

```bash
cp -r ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2023/‚ÄúWeek 00" ds-prep-workspace
>
```

Make sure to use this type of quotes `"` and not these ones `‚Äú`.

### 6. When setting up python 3.8 I get an error

When I run this command:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```

I get this error:

```bash
W: GPG error: http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt focal-pgdg InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8
```

Solution: Take the id in front of `NO_PUBKEY` (in my case it's `7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8`) and run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8
```

### 7. Nothing happens when I type my password

When you type your password in the terminal, it is not visible. This is normal, just type the password and hit <kbd>enter</kbd>.
